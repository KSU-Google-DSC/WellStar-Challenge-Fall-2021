# WellStar-Challenge
This is the final submission for the Fall 2021 Hackathon Wellstar Challenge.

We were tasked to redesign a navbar to be more user friendly. Our approach was to separate everything by views based on the experience that
the user selects. This way, any and all information will be related to them instead of crowding them with everything.

The navbar is built using React, NextJS & TailwindCSS to provide a mobile-first experience while also appealing to Desktop users.

The entire project is open sourced under the MIT license. 

> **Edit:** This submission got second place.
